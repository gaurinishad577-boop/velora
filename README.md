### Project Description
[**Recycle Rewards** is a sustainability-driven digital platform that incentivizes responsible recycling by transforming everyday waste into redeemable value. Users earn reward points for recycling, which can be exchanged for vouchers, coupons, and gift cards, while businesses gain access to verified recyclable materials through a streamlined marketplace. The platform bridges environmental responsibility with tangible economic benefits, fostering a circular and reward-based ecosystem.


### The Problem statement

**Problem Statement:**
Despite growing environmental awareness, recycling rates remain low due to a lack of direct incentives, limited transparency, and inefficient connections between consumers and recycling buyers. Individuals often see little personal benefit in responsible waste disposal, while companies struggle to access reliable streams of recyclable materials. There is a critical need for an integrated platform that incentivizes sustainable behavior, increases recycling participation, and creates a transparent marketplace connecting recyclers with businesses.


### The Solution
[Recycle Rewards is a technology-driven platform that incentivizes responsible recycling by converting recyclable waste into measurable reward points redeemable for vouchers, gift cards, and exclusive offers. By integrating user verification, digital tracking, and a transparent reward system, the platform motivates individuals to actively participate in sustainable waste management. Simultaneously, it provides businesses with streamlined access to verified recyclable materials, creating a reliable circular economy ecosystem that aligns environmental responsibility with economic value.
